### My .emacs.d (woo)

Format (and several files) shamelessly copied from https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d

Mostly pared back, though lots of new modes have been added since I
first cloned and trimmed that repo. I also (finally) switched from my
hacky cream colored background to using the Solarized theme, which
makes me happy in a very Tufte-ish way.
